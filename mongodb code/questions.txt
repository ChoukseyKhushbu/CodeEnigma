	"description" : `Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.</br>We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the triplet <code>A = (a0,a1,a2)</code>, and the rating for Bob's challenge to be the triplet <code>B = (b0,b1,b2)</code>.</br>Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing a0 with b0, a1 with b1, and a2 with b2.
	<ul>
<li>If ai > bi, then Alice is awarded 1 point.</li>
<li>If ai < bi, then Bob is awarded 1 point.</li>
<li>If ai = bi, then neither person receives a point.</li>
	</ul>
	</br>Comparison points is the total points a person earned.</br>Given  and , can you compare the two challenges and print their respective comparison points?`,
